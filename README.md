# PIN-for-Admin
This script allows users to request temporary admin privileges. When the time is up it demotes the user and any other accounts that did not originally have admin privileges. The privileges are only granted if the user is able to provide a random PIN that the script generates and sends to an attribute of choice in Jamf Pro.
